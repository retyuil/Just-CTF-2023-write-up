# ECC for dummies

This challenge is dealing with Error correction code.

We have to guess 5 bits. To do that we can ask 8 question but in the 8 response 3 will be false.

We could come up with a strategy to solve the challenge but we only need to guess 5 bits so we can just bruteforce the challenge by triying all possibilities.
